# 4.6 Particle Cloud Code

Next, you'll modify your "Smart Security" device app to allow a web app to interact with your Photon through the internet.

## Particle Cloud {#particle-cloud}

Remember that all your Photon's internet communications are routed through Particle Cloud, which provides these ways for your web app to interact with your Photon device:

1. A web app can **get the value of a Photon device variable**
2. A web app can **call a custom function on a Photon device**
3. A web app can **get event notifications from a Photon device**

The web app that you'll be creating for your "Smart Security" device will perform these tasks:

1. The web app will display whether the security device is currently armed or disarmed. The web app will do this by getting the value of the `deviceMode` variable in your Photon device app.
2. The web app will display a toggle switch that can be clicked to remotely toggle the security device between armed and disarmed mode. The web app will do this by calling the `toggleMode()` function in your Photon device app.
3. The web app will display a notification if the security device detects motion when the device is armed. The web app will also display the date and time of the most recent motion notification. The web app will do this by receiving event notifications sent from your Photon device app.

You'll need to add some code to your Photon device app to allow it to interact with your web app.

## Share Variable and Function

Your Photon app should already have code statements from your "Smart Light" app that you modified to share the `deviceMode` variable and `toggleMode()` function through Particle Cloud.

Be sure the following code is **already** listed within the `setup()` function:

```cpp
Particle.variable("deviceMode", deviceMode);
Particle.function("toggleMode", toggleMode);
```

## Send Event Notification

Your Photon device app can send an event notification using the`Particle.publish()` method. This will create a "cloud event" in Particle Cloud that streams the event notification to your web app. By default, Particle Cloud will clear each cloud event after 60 seconds to prevent your web app from receiving duplicate notifications or outdated notifications.

An event notification can be sent with or without data. An event notification sent **without data** acts like a simple alert that the event occurred. An event notification sent **with data** will include additional information as a text string \(up to 255 characters\).

Particle Cloud will allow your Photon device to send about 1 event notification per second. If your device sends event notifications more frequently than this, Particle Cloud will intentionally slow down your event stream \(with a 4-second delay\), which can cause issues with your web app. To prevent this, your code should include a `delay()` of at least 1 second after a `Particle.publish()` statement.  \(A 1-second delay added by you is better than getting a 4-second delay added by Particle Cloud.\)

For your Smart Security device, your Photon app should send an event notification \(without additional data\) whenever the motion sensor detects motion.

Send an event notification through Particle Cloud by adding this code statement **within** your `checkMotion()` custom function \(**after** the `tone()` statement but **before** the `delay()` statement\):

```cpp
Particle.publish("motion");
```

The `Particle.publish()` method requires a parameter for the **cloud event name**, which can be up to 63 characters in length. The name must be listed within double quotation marks. In this case, `"motion"` will be the name of the cloud event.

## Flash App to Device

Flash your app code to your Photon device by clicking the **Flash** icon in the left navigation bar. 

Once your Photon has downloaded the app and restarted, the updated app will start running. You shouldn't notice any changes in the device's behavior, but your Photon app will now send a `"motion"` event notification to Particle Cloud every time motion is detected while the device is armed.
