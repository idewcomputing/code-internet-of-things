# 4.7 Web App HTML

Next, you'll create a web app that will interact with your Smart Security device through Particle Cloud. Your web app will consist of an HTML file named`index.html`, a CSS file named `style.css`, and a JavaScript file named `code.js`.

Particle Build is only used to code your Photon device app. You'll need to use a different code editor to create the HTML, CSS, and JS files for your web app. Consult your teacher to determine which code editor will be most appropriate to use for your web app files.
