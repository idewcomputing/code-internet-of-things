# 4.1 Connect Motion Sensor

{% hint style="success" %}
**NEED LED & BUTTON:**  Be sure the LED and button from your "Smart Light" device are still connected. If not, [connect an LED](https://docs.idew.org/code-internet-of-things/references/physical-outputs/led-lights) to the **D0** pin and [connect a push button](https://docs.idew.org/code-internet-of-things/references/physical-inputs/push-buttons) to the **D2** pin.
{% endhint %}

Your Photon kit includes a motion sensor that uses passive infrared \(PIR\) light to detect movement in the surrounding environment up to 10 feet away.

In this step, your team will connect the motion sensor to your Photon circuit board using the breadboard.

You'll need these components:

* Motion sensor \(with 3-pin connector\)
* 3 jumper wires \(use different colors to help identify them; it may help to match the sensor wires\)

[Follow these instructions explaining how to connect the motion sensor](https://docs.idew.org/code-internet-of-things/references/physical-inputs/motion-sensor). The sensor can be connected to almost any I/O pin, but connect it to the **D3** pin \(which will be **different** from the wiring diagram\).
