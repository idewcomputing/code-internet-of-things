# 4.2 Connect Speaker

Your Photon kit includes a speaker that can be used to produce tones or play simple music \(note by note\). The speaker can produce tones ranging in frequency from 20Hz \(very low pitch\) to 20KHz \(very high pitch\), which covers the full range of sounds that humans can hear.

In this step, your team will connect the speaker to your Photon circuit board using the breadboard.

You'll need these components:

* Speaker
* 2 jumper wires \(use different colors to help identify them\)

[â€‹Follow these instructions explaining how to connect the speaker](https://docs.idew.org/code-internet-of-things/references/physical-outputs/speaker). The speaker can be connected to any I/O pin capable of PWM, but connect it to the **D1** pin \(which will be **different** from the wiring diagram\).
