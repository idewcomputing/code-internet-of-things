# 4.2 Connect Speaker

In this step, your team will connect a speaker to your Photon circuit board using the breadboard.

You'll need these components:

* Speaker
* 2 jumper wires \(use different colors to help identify them\)

[â€‹Follow these instructions explaining how to connect the speaker](https://docs.idew.org/code-internet-of-things/references/physical-outputs/speaker). The speaker can be connected to any I/O pin capable of PWM, but connect it to the **D1** pin \(which will be **different** than the wiring diagram\).
