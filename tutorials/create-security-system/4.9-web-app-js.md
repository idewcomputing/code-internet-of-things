# 4.9 Web App JS

Next, you'll add JavaScript code to allow your web app to interact with your Photon device through Particle Cloud. Remember that the web app will perform these tasks:

1. The web app will display whether the security device is currently armed or disarmed. The web app will do this by getting the value of the `deviceMode` variable in your Photon device app.
2. The web app will display a toggle switch that can be clicked to remotely toggle the security device between armed and disarmed mode. The web app will do this by calling the `toggleMode()` function in your Photon device app.
3. The web app will display a notification if the security device detects motion when the device is armed. The web app will also display the date and time of the most recent motion notification. The web app will do this by receiving event notifications sent from your Photon device app.

## Add Starter JS {#add-starter-html}

[â€‹Copy this starter JS for your web app](https://docs.idew.org/code-internet-of-things/references/web-app#js), and paste it into a **blank** JS file named `code.js`.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**IMPORTANT:** You must modify this JS code to [insert your actual Photon device ID and access token](https://docs.idew.org/code-internet-of-things/references/particle-cloud/web-app-prep-steps#device-id-and-access-token). Otherwise, your web app will **not** work properly.
{% endhint %}

## Add Custom JS {#add-custom-html}

Copy this JS, and add it **after** your modified starter JS:

```javascript
var alertSound = new Audio("notification.wav");

window.setInterval(checkMode, 500);

function checkMode() {
    particle.getVariable({ deviceId: myDevice, name: "deviceMode", auth: myToken }).then(function(data) {
        // add code to do something with value returned as: data.body.result
        if (data.body.result == "armed") {
            $("#system-mode").html("ARMED");
            $("input[name=toggle]").prop("checked", true);
        }
        else if (data.body.result == "disarmed") {
            $("#system-mode").html("DISARMED");
            $("input[name=toggle]").prop("checked", false);
        }
    }, function(err) {
            console.log("An error occurred: ", err);
    });
}

function toggleMode() {
    particle.callFunction({ deviceId: myDevice, name: "toggleMode", argument: "data", auth: myToken });
}

particle.getEventStream({ deviceId: myDevice, name: "motion", auth: myToken }).then(function(stream) {
  stream.on('event', function(feed) {
    // add code to do something when event notification received
    // any text data received is stored as: feed.data
    alertSound.play();
    var date = new Date();
    var dateTime = date.toLocaleString();
    $("#event-time").html(dateTime);
    $("#motion-alert").show().delay(1500).fadeOut();
  });
});
```

This custom JS does 5 main things:

1. Stores an audio file in a JS global variable named `alertSound`
2. Sets a time interval to call a JS function named `checkMode()`
3. Adds a JS function named `checkMode()` that will get the value of a Photon variable
4. Adds a JS function named `toggleMode()` that will call a Photon function
5. Starts listening for `"motion"` event notifications sent by your Photon device

### Variable for Audio File

A variable named `alertSound` is declared that stores an audio file named `"notification.wav"`. [Download a copy of this audio file](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MYgo-SFuQLOSA2Z0tW8eVqg_5P6EYtc1), and place it in the **same folder** as your web app files.

### Set Interval to Call JS Function

The `window.setInterval()` method will automatically call a function named `checkMode()` every `500` ms \(0.5 seconds\).

### JS Function to Get Photon Variable

The function named `checkMode()` contains a call to the `particle.getVariable()` method that will get the current value of the `"deviceMode"` variable in your Photon app.

Inside the `particle.getVariable()` method are JS and jQuery code statements \(lines 8-15 above\) that were added to perform actions based on the value returned for the Photon variable.

An if-else statement is used to determine whether `data.body.result` has a value equivalent to `"armed"` or `"disarmed"`. Then jQuery statements \(which start with `$`\) are used to dynamically change the information displayed in the first "card" by targeting specific [id selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_selectors.asp):

* `$("#system-mode")` targets the HTML element with `id="system-mode"`. The jQuery statements change this element's HTML to list either `ARMED` or `DISARMED`.
* `$("input [name=toggle])` targets the `<input>` element with `name="toggle"`. The jQuery statements change its `"checked"` property to either `true` \(checked\) or `false` \(unchecked\), which changes the toggle switch slider position.

### JS Function to Call Photon Function

The function named `toggleMode()` contains a call to the `particle.callFunction()` method that will call the `"toggleMode"` function in your Photon app to remotely switch your device's mode between "armed" and "disarmed".

The `<input type="checkbox">` in your web app HTML contains an [onclick event attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ev_onclick.asp) that will call this `toggleMode()` function whenever the toggle switch in the web app is clicked.

### Listen for Event Notifications

The `particle.getEventStream()` method is used to start listening for `"motion"` event notifications sent from your Photon app. Inside the `particle.getEventStream()` method are JS and jQuery code statements \(lines 29-33 above\) that will be performed each time a new event notification is received:

* Play `alertSound`
* Get the current date and time and store it in a variable named `dateTime`
* Display the value of `dateTime` in the HTML element with `id="event-time"`
* Show the HTML element with `id="motion-alert"`, wait for `1500` ms \(1.5 seconds\), and then fade out the element until it is hidden. This creates a visible "pop-up" notification in your web app.

## Test Web App

Be sure your Photon device is connected to Wi-Fi and Particle Cloud.

Refresh your web app, and test it with your Photon device to make sure they interact correctly:

* Verify that your web app displays the current mode \("armed" or "disarmed"\) of your Smart Security device. Use the push button connected to your Photon device to change the device mode.  When the LED is turned on, the device is in "armed" mode. When the LED is turned off, the device is "disarmed." Verify that your web app updates automatically to show the correct device mode.
* Verify that your web app can remotely change the device mode. Click the toggle switch in your web app, and verify that your Photon device automatically toggles modes \(by checking the LED\). It may take up to 2 seconds for the mode to switch due to the `delay(2000)` in the Photon app.
* While your Smart Security device is in "armed" mode, trigger a motion alert. Verify that your web app displays a motion notification pop-up \(which will fade out after 1.5 seconds\). Verify the web app displays the correct date and time for the last motion event notification.

## Going Further

If you have time and want to learn how to use the other inputs and outputs in your Photon kit, you could explore the [SparkFun Photon Experiment Guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-for-photon-experiment-guide).  \(You can skip ahead to Experiment 3 or later.\)

There are also references in this guidebook that show and explain how to connect and code each of the [physical inputs](../../references/physical-inputs/) and [physical outputs](../../references/physical-outputs/) in your Photon kit.

Your team should now be ready to start designing and building its own smart device for your project.
