# 3.1 Connect LED

LEDs \(light-emitting diodes\) are small, bright, long-lasting, energy-efficient lights. Your Photon kit has a set of LED lights in various colors:  red, yellow, green, and blue.

In this first step, your team will connect an LED light to your Photon circuit board using the breadboard.

You'll need these components:

* 1 LED light \(any color\)
* 1 resistor
* 2 jumper wires \(use two different colors to help identify them\)

[Follow these instructions explaining how to connect the LED](https://docs.idew.org/code-internet-of-things/references/physical-outputs/led-lights#how-to-connect-led).  The LED can be connected to almost any I/O pin, but go ahead and connect it to the **D0** pin \(same as wiring diagram in instructions\).
