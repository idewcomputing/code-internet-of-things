# 3.1 Connect LED

LEDs \(light-emitting diodes\) are small, bright, long-lasting, energy-efficient lights. Your Photon kit has a set of LED lights in various colors:  red, yellow, green, and blue.

To connect an LED light to your Photon circuit board using the breadboard, you will need:

* 1 LED light \(any color\)
* 1 resistor
* 2 jumper wires \(use two different colors to help identify them\)

Follow these instructions to connect the LED.
