# 3.3 Connect Button

Physical buttons that people can push are used as inputs on many different types of devices. Your Photon kit should have a set of 4 push buttons in various colors: red, yellow, green, and blue.

In this step, your team will connect a push button to your Photon circuit board using the breadboard.

You'll need these components:

* 1 push button \(could be any color, but use same color as your LED\)
* 2 jumper wires \(use two different colors to help identify them\)

[Follow these instructions explaining how to connect the push button](https://docs.idew.org/code-internet-of-things/references/physical-inputs/push-buttons#how-to-connect-button).  The button can be connected to almost any I/O pin, but go ahead and connect it to the **D2** pin \(same as wiring diagram in instructions\).
