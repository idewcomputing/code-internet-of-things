## What is a Smart Light?

The [Philips Hue](http://www2.meethue.com/en-us/) smart light bulb was introduced in 2012. Today, there are several companies that offer smart light bulb systems.



From the outside, a smart light looks similar to a regular light bulb and is inserted into light sockets in the same way. However, the inside of a smart light bulb contains multiple LED lights that are wired to a microcontroller which connects to your Wi-Fi network.

Smart lights have mobile apps that allow you to control an individual light or a group of lights. The smart light apps offer features such as:

* Remotely turn the light\(s\) on or off
* Set automatic timers to turn the light\(s\) on or off at specific times
* Adjust the brightness of the light\(s\)
* Change the color of the light\(s\)
* Sync the light\(s\) to music or movies
