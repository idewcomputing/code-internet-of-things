# 3.4 Add Button Code

Next, you'll add code in your "Smart Light" app to control the LED using the push button.

The basic steps to use a push button in your app code are:

1. Declare a global variable to store the I/O pin number for the button.
2. Set the pin mode for the button pin in the `setup()` function.
3. Use a `digitalRead()` statement to check whether the button is currently pressed, and add code statements that should be performed if the button is pressed \(or not pressed\).

## Global Variable for Button Pin

Declare a global variable to store the I/O pin number for the button by adding this code statement before your `setup()` function:

```cpp
int button = D2;
```

If you connected your button to a different I/O pin other than `D2`, then modify this code statement to list the correct pin number for your button.
