Next, you'll modify your device app to allow a web app to interact with your Photon device over the internet through Particle Cloud.

## Particle Cloud

All of your Photon's internet communications are routed through the Particle Cloud service, which offers these ways that your web app can interact with your Photon device through Particle Cloud:

1. A web app can **get the value of a Photon device variable**
2. A web app can **call a custom function on a Photon device**
3. A web app can **get event notifications from a Photon device**
