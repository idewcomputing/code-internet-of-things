# 1.3 Electric Circuits

{% hint style="success" %}
**GOAL:**  Understand how to create electric circuits by connecting parts to the IoT circuit board \(use of pins, jumper wires, breadboard, and power\)
{% endhint %}

## Electric Circuits

Each input and output connected to your Photon circuit board must form an [electric circuit](https://www.dummies.com/programming/electronics/components/what-is-an-electronic-circuit/), which is a continuous path that conducts electricity from the positive \(+\) end of a power source through a "load" \(such as an input or output\) and back to the negative \(-\) end of the power source.

Each input and output should have its own electric circuit, so they can be independently controlled. These are called **parallel** circuits.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**AVOID SHORT CIRCUITS:**  Do **NOT** try this, but if you were to connect a wire directly from the positive side of a power source to the negative side \(without any input or output in the middle to act as the "load"\), you'd create a [short circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_circuit) that leads to excessive current flow.

Short circuits can possibly:  burn up your wire, damage your circuit board, damage your USB power supply, damage or drain your battery, etc.
{% endhint %}

## Power for Circuit Board

The power for your circuits will be supplied by the Photon circuit board, which itself must receive power from another source.

The Photon circuit board can receive power through either one of its power supply ports:

* **Barrel Jack:**  A barrel jack adapter can be plugged in to provide power from an external supply such as a battery or outlet. The Photon kit includes a barrel jack adapter to connect a 9V battery.
* **USB:**  A Micro-USB cable can be plugged in to provide power from a computer's USB port or a USB charger. The Photon kit includes a USB to Micro-USB cable.

{% hint style="success" %}
**CHOOSE ONE:**  Only **one** power source \(USB or 9V battery\) needs to be connected to the Photon circuit board. Using a USB power source offers the advantage of not having to replace batteries, while using a battery power source offers the advantage of mobility.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**CAUTION:**  Be careful when plugging or unplugging the Micro-USB cable to avoid breaking the USB port on the Photon circuit board. Be sure the correct side of the cable is facing up.
{% endhint %}

## Power for Inputs and Outputs

The Photon circuit board can supply power to inputs and outputs through these pins:

### Positive Pins

* **I/O Pins:**  These pins can supply 3.3 volts \(by reducing the incoming voltage from the USB or barrel jack power source\). Only certain inputs and outputs will get their power from an I/O pin.
* **3.3V:**  This pin supplies 3.3 volts \(by reducing the incoming voltage from the USB or barrel jack power source\).
* **V-USB:**  If a USB power source is connected, this pin supplies ~5 volts.
* **VIN:**  If an external power supply is connected to the barrel jack, this pin supplies the same voltage as the external supply \(which could range from 4.5-15 volts\).  For example, if a 9V battery with adapter is plugged into the barrel jack, this pin would supply 9 volts.

### Negative Pins

* **GND:**  This pin acts as the ground \(negative terminal\) when powering inputs and outputs. The Photon circuit board has 3 available GND pins.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**CAUTION:**  The inputs and outputs in your Photon kit have different power requirements:

* Certain inputs and outputs \(such as: micro OLED display, etc.\) require **only 3.3 volts** of power – using a higher voltage could damage these parts.
* Certain inputs and outputs \(such as: servo motor, etc.\) require **5 volts or more** – using a lower voltage could prevent these parts from working.
{% endhint %}

## Breadboard

A breadboard has a large number of additional pins \(plugs\) that are useful for connecting inputs and outputs to your circuit board. First, your inputs and outputs connect to pins in the breadboard, and then jumper wires are used to help connect those breadboard pins to specific pins on your circuit board.

One purpose of using a breadboard is it allows you to connect multiple inputs and outputs to some of the same power supply pins – while still ensuring that each input and output has its own parallel circuit.

For example, the Photon circuit board has only one V-USB pin to supply 5V of power, but your device might have multiple inputs and outputs that require 5V – so the breadboard can be used to allow these parts to share this one V-USB pin.

### Anatomy of Breadboard

To understand how a breadboard works and is used, you need to understand the "anatomy" of your breadboard.  The image on the left below shows an external view of your breadboard, while the image on the right shows what's inside the breadboard:

![External View of Breadboard \(on left\) and Internal View of Breadboard \(on right\)](../../.gitbook/assets/breadboard-inside.jpg)

First, let's examine the external view of your breadboard. While the breadboard might seem like one rectangle of holes, it actually consists of 4 separate rectangular sections:

1. On the far left is a **power rail** consisting of two columns of pins:  one column is labeled as positive \(+\) and the other column is labeled as negative \(-\).
2. In the left center is a set of **terminal strips** consisting of rows of pins:  each row is numbered \(from 1-30\) and the pins within each row are lettered \(from a-e\).
3. In the right center is another set of **terminal strips** consisting of rows of pins:  each row is numbered \(from 1-30\) and the pins within each row are lettered \(from f-j\). Notice that there is a divide between the left set of terminal strips and the right set of terminal strips.
4. On the far right is another **power rail** consisting of two columns of pins:  one column is labeled as positive \(+\) and the other column is labeled as negative \(-\).

Inside the breadboard, there are metal strips underneath the pin holes. The breadboard image on the right above shows these metal strips – and makes it easier to visualize the 4 separate sections.  \(The red arrows are pointing to the metal strips under the power rails.\)

When you plug a wire into a breadboard pin, the wire makes contact with the specific metal strip underneath that pin location. If another wire is plugged into another pin along the **same** metal strip, that metal strip will allow electricity to be conducted between the different wires.

While these metal strips may be "hidden" inside your breadboard, they will become part of your circuits as you connect inputs and outputs to your Photon.
