# 1.2 Other Parts in Kit

{% hint style="success" %}
**GOAL:**  Identify the other parts in your IoT kit and their purposes \(inputs, outputs, connectors, cables\)

**TASK:**  Review the information below, and then complete [this assignment](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1op5CGn4ZSe-FFW_nTxTW_Yz_FeZpcXrW0pxKeu_eFF0) by finding each part in your kit & identifying its name and function.
{% endhint %}

## Physical Inputs

Your Photon kit includes these physical inputs, which can be connected to your circuit board:

* **Push Buttons** – detects if button is being pushed \(kit has red, yellow, green & blue buttons\)
* **Trimpot Dial** – detects position of dial \(can be turned clockwise or counter-clockwise\)
* **Motion Sensor** – detects if something is moving in nearby environment
* **Magnetic Switch** – detects if something is open or closed \(such as door, window, etc.\)
* **Photocell \(Light Sensor\)** – measures amount of light in environment
* **Humidity & Temperature Sensor** – measures relative humidity & temperature of air
* **Soil Moisture Sensor** – measures amount of moisture in soil \(or similar material\)
* **Accelerometer** – measures acceleration or tilt in 3 dimensions; can also detect taps or bumps

The following is **not** a standard part of the Photon kit, but your teacher may have added it:

* \*\*\*\*[**Ultrasonic Sensor**](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13959) – measures distance to nearest object

## Physical Outputs

Your Photon kit includes these physical outputs, which can be connected to your circuit board:

* **LED Lights** – produces light \(kit has red, yellow, green & blue LED lights\)
* **Speaker** – produces sound \(tone\) at any frequency from 20Hz to 20kHz
* **Servo Motor** – rotates to any angle from 0° to ~180°
* **Micro OLED Display** – displays text and simple graphics in monochrome

## Connectors

Your Photon kit includes these parts used to help connect inputs and outputs to your circuit board:

* **Breadboard** – provides additional pins to help connect and power your inputs and outputs
* **Jumper Wires** – help connect inputs and outputs to pins on breadboard and circuit board
* **Resistors** – help limit electric current for certain inputs or outputs \(such as LED lights, etc.\)

## Cables

Your Photon kit includes these cables to provide power to your circuit board:

* **USB to Micro-USB Cable** – powers circuit board by connecting to USB port or charger
* **9V to Barrel Jack Adapter** – powers circuit board by connecting to 9V battery

{% hint style="info" %}
**FYI:**  Only **one** power source \(USB or 9V battery\) needs to be connected.
