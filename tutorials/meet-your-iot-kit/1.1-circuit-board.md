# 1.1 Circuit Board

**Goal:**  Understand the features of your IoT circuit board \(pins, ports, buttons, LED lights\)

## Circuit Board

The SparkFun Photon kit contains a printed circuit board \(PCB\) that incorporates the Particle Photon P1 microcontroller, which will act like the “brain” of your IoT device. This circuit board also has various pins, ports, buttons, and LED lights. SparkFun refers to this circuit board as the Photon RedBoard \(because of its color\).

## Photon Microcontroller

A microcontroller is a small computer on a single integrated circuit that contains a processor \(CPU\), memory, storage, and programmable input/output pins. The Photon microcontroller also has an integrated Wi-Fi chip, which makes it great for IoT devices.

### Photon P1 Tech Specs

* **CPU:** 32-bit 120Mhz ARM Cortex M3
* **Memory:** 128KB RAM
* **Storage:** 1MB Flash
* **Wi-Fi:** 2.4GHz 802.11b/g/n

Compared to the tech specs of a "regular" computer, a microcontroller is much less powerful – it has a slower processor, less memory, and less storage. This is because microcontrollers are used in devices that have **dedicated** functions \(such as: automobile engine control systems, medical devices, remote controls, office machines, appliances, toys, etc.\). These dedicated devices don’t require as much computing power as a general purpose computer \(such as phone, tablet, or desktop\).
