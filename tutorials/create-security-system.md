# 4. Create Security System

Guide to creating a 2nd practice device:  a simple security system created by modifying the Smart Light device \(by adding motion sensor + speaker\) and modifying the Smart Light apps

Alternatively, teams could create their own 2nd practice device by adding one new physical input + one new physical output of their choice \(e.g., add trimpot dial + speaker, add temp sensor + micro OLED display, etc.\) - new device doesn't have to perform useful task \(instead emphasis is on practicing wiring & coding with new set of parts\)
