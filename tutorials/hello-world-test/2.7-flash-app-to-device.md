# 2.7 Flash App to Device

Next you'll flash your "Hello World" app to your Photon device to run the app.

## Flash App to Photon

Be sure your Photon is powered on and connected to Wi-Fi and Particle Cloud.

Flash your app code to your Photon device by clicking the **Flash** icon in the left navigation bar. \(Particle Build will first save and verify your code before flashing it.\)

Your Photon will download the app from Particle Cloud over Wi-Fi and store the app in your Photon's flash memory. While this is occurring, you should see that the RGB light on your Photon's circuit board will **blink pink**.

Once the download is complete, your Photon will automatically restart itself. You'll see the RGB light on your Photon **blink green** while it tries to reconnect to Wi-Fi. Once your Photon has reconnected to Wi-Fi and Particle Cloud, the RGB will be **"breathing" cyan** \(light blue\).

## Confirm App Works

Once your Photon has downloaded the new app and restarted, your new app will automatically start running:

* Confirm that the blue D7 LED light on your Photon's circuit board blinks on and off in a repeating pattern \(with the light turning on for 1 second and then turning off for 1 second\).

If so, then you've successfully programmed the "Hello World" app for your Photon device. Your teacher may want to see your Photon device to confirm that your team's app is working.

**APP ISSUES:**  If the app **doesn't** work correctly \(such as:  D7 LED doesn't turn on, D7 LED doesn't turn off, etc.\), then double-check your app code in Particle Build. If necessary, consult with another team or your teacher to figure out what the issue might be.
