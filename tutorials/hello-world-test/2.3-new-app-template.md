# 2.3 New App Template

Let's name your new app template, and learn about the basic code structure for Photon device apps.

## Name Your App

In the Code menu panel, you'll notice that your current app doesn't have a title yet.

It's recommended to give each app a unique title. Particle Build will allow you to save different apps that have the same title â€“ but this could get confusing, so try to use unique app titles.

**NOTE:**  You **cannot** have any blank spaces in an app's title. If you want to visually separate words in your app's title, just use a hyphen or an underscore.

Enter `hello-world` as your app's title.

You'll see the app's title show up in the "My Apps" list.

{% hint style="info" %}
**HOW TO RENAME APP:**  If you want to change the title of your current app, just click the title to enter a different name.
{% endhint %}

## Photon App Structure

Your code editor should show the basic structure for a new Photon device app:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="blank.ino" %}
```cpp
void setup() {

}

void loop() {

}
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

Brief explanation of setup\(\) and loop\(\) functions

Brief explanation of other code that can be added - such as: global variables, included libraries, custom functions
