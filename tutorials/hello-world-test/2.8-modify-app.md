# 2.8 Modify App

Your last step is to modify the "Hello World" app, as some extra practice.

## Modify App Code

In Particle Build, modify the code within the `loop()` function to change the LED blinking pattern. Here are some possible options your team could choose:

* Make the D7 LED blink faster
* Make the D7 LED blink slower
* Make the D7 LED blink in a different pattern \(such as two quick blinks followed by a longer pause\)

### Add Comment Block

To help identify your app, add this comment block by inserting it at the very top of your code:

```cpp
/*
Team Name
Hello World App
Describe modification
*/
```

Modify the comment block to list your team's name and describe your team's modification to the app.

## Flash Modified App

Flash your modified app to your Photon to confirm it does what you intended it to do.

Your teacher may want to see your modified app code running on your Photon.

## Download Copy of App

If you need to download a copy of your app code to your computer in order to submit it to your teacher, there are two different download icons shown in the Code Menu panel:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pb-download-files.png)

1. The **first icon** \(cloud with download arrow\) to the right of "Current App" is used to download the compiled version of the app \(firmware binary\).
2. The **second icon** \(angle brackets with download arrow\) to the right of "Files" is used to download a zip file containing your app source code \(`.ino` file\).

Click the **second** download icon to download a zip file containing your app source code:

![Download Icon](../../.gitbook/assets/pb-download-icon.png)

In this case, the zip file will be named `hello-world.zip`. You'll need to uncompress the zip file to get your app source code file, which will be named `hello-word.ino`. If necessary, this `.ino` file can be opened in a text editor on your computer.

**UNCOMPRESS ZIP:**  To uncompress a zip file downloaded to your computer:

* On a **Windows** computer, right-click the zip file, and select "Extract All." Browse to the destination folder where you want to save the uncompressed file, and click "Extract."
* On a **Mac** computer, just double-click the zip file.
