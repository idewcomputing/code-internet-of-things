# 2.8 Modify App

Your last step is to modify the "Hello World" app, in order to be sure you understand how it works.

## Modify App Code

In Particle Build, modify the code within the `loop()` function to change the D7 LED blinking pattern. Here are some possible options your team could choose:

* Make the D7 LED blink faster
* Make the D7 LED blink slower
* Make the D7 LED blink in a different pattern \(such as two quick blinks followed by a longer pause\)

## Flash Modified App

Flash your modified app to your Photon to confirm it does what you intended it to do.
