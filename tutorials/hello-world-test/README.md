# 2. Hello World Test

## Tutorial Goals

The goals of this second tutorial are to help you:

* Verify your Photon device connects to Wi-Fi and the Particle Cloud service
* Understand how to use Particle Build to create Photon device apps
* Create a Hello World app to test your Photon device

## How does the Photon connect to Wi-Fi?

When your Photon is powered on \(or restarted\), it will automatically try to connect to a Wi-Fi network.  It does this by using a saved list of Wi-Fi logins \(network names and passwords\). The Photon can be programmed to store login information for up to 5 different Wi-Fi networks.

A brand new Photon will **not** have any Wi-Fi logins saved yet. The Photon provided to you by your teacher should already have one or more Wi-Fi logins programmed into it.

## What is Particle Cloud?

Once your Photon is connected to Wi-Fi, the Photon will automatically try to connect to Particle Cloud, which is a cloud service that Particle provides for all of its microcontroller devices. All of your Photon's internet communications are routed through Particle Cloud.

Particle Cloud can be used to:

* Code and store all your different Photon device apps \(using Particle Build\)
* Update the app stored on your Photon device
* Update the firmware on your Photon device
* Send and receive data between your Photon device app and your web app
* Manage your Photon device remotely

## What is Particle Build?

Particle Build is an online code editor \(web IDE\) provided by Particle. 

## What is a Hello World app?

Explain purpose of Hello World app

Explain what this specific app will do \(make built-in LED blink repeatedly\)

Explain that Photon device apps coded in Wiring programming language \(nearly identical to Arduino\)
