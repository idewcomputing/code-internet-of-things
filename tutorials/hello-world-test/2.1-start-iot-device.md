# 2.1 Start IoT Device

Let's start your Photon by powering on the circuit board:  Connect a power cable into the barrel jack or Micro-USB port on the circuit board, and connect the other end of the cable to a power source \(such as:  battery, computer USB port, etc.\).

{% hint style="success" %}
**CHOOSE ONE:**  Only **one** power source \(barrel jack or Micro-USB\) needs to be connected to the Photon circuit board.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**REMINDER:**  The Photon circuit board does **not** have an "on/off" switch. As soon as a power source is connected to its barrel jack or Micro-USB port, the Photon will power on and start running. To turn off the Photon, you'll have to disconnect its power source.
{% endhint %}

Once the circuit board has power, you should see its red Power LED light turn on.

You should also see the RGB LED light turn on â€“ blinking green while the Photon automatically tries to connect to Wi-Fi.

Once the Photon has successfully connected to Wi-Fi and Particle Cloud, the RGB LED will be cyan \(light blue\) and "breathing" \(slow blinking\).

{% hint style="warning" %}
**CONNECTION ISSUES:**  If your Photon is having issues \(can't connect to Wi-Fi, etc.\), you'll see a [different RGB pattern](https://docs.idew.org/code-internet-of-things/tutorials/meet-your-iot-kit/1.1-circuit-board#normal-rgb-patterns) \(such as:  breathing green, breathing pink, etc.\). You may have to troubleshoot your device.
