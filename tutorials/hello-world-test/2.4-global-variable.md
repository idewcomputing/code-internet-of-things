# 2.4 Global Variable

Let's add a variable in your app code to represent the built-in LED light.

## Add Global Variable for LED

Your "Hello World" app will make the Photon's built-in LED light turn on and off in a blinking pattern. This will be accomplished by sending separate "on" and "off" signals to the LED's pin.

Each I/O pin on the Photon circuit board is identified by a pin number \(such as:  A0, A1, A2, D0, D1, D2, etc.\). In this case, the Photon's built-in LED light is connected to pin D7 \(via internal circuitry\).

When coding an app, you will typically create a global variable to store a pin number for each input or output that is connected to your Photon. This will help make your code easier to understand because the variable names will help identify each input or output.

You'll need to create a global variable to store the pin number of the built-in LED. Add this code to your app by inserting it \(as a separate line of code\) **before** the `setup()` function:

```cpp
int LED = D7;
```

This line of code does 3 things \(in order\):

1. **It declares a data type for the variable's value.**  In this case, `int` stands for integer \(whole number\). Photon pin numbers are always treated as `int` values \(even though they have letters\).
2. **It declares the variable's name.** In this case, the variable will be called `LED`. You get to decide what to name your variables. Choose names that will make sense to anyone reviewing your code.
3. **It assigns a value to the variable.**  In this case, the variable's value will be equal to `D7`, which is the pin number for the Photon's built-in LED light.

## Save Your App Code

The Particle Build code editor does **NOT** autosave your work as you type, so be sure to periodically save your code.

Save your app code by clicking the **Save** icon in the left navigation bar.

## Tips for Naming Variables

You get to decide what to name each variable in your app's code. However, here are a few rules and recommendations to help you name your variables:

#### RULES

* Each global variable must have a unique name.
* A variable's name **cannot** be one of the [keywords in the Wiring programming language](http://www.wiring.org.co/reference/).
* Variable names must be one word \(no spaces allowed\).
* Variable names can contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and certain special characters \(such as underscores, etc.\) – but the name **cannot** start with a number.

#### RECOMMENDATIONS

* Make each variable's name concise yet descriptive, so it will be easy to read and understand.
  * Example of variable name that's concise yet descriptive:  `button`
  * Example of variable name that's **too** concise:  `b`
  * Example of variable name that's **too** descriptive: `greenbuttonthatturnsdeviceon`
* If your variable name combines multiple words, you can make the name easier to read either by using an underscore between words – or by using "[camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case)" \(lowercase letters, but new words start with a capital letter\).
  * Examples of variable names using underscores:  `red_light`, `motion_sensor`
  * Examples of variable names using camelCase:  `redLight`, `motionSensor`
* If you have multiple inputs or outputs of the same type \(multiple LED lights, multiple buttons, etc.\), add an adjective or number to their variable names to help identify them in your app code.
  * Examples of variable names with adjectives:  `redLED`, `blueLED`
  * Examples of variable names with numbers:  `button1`, `button2`
