# Servo Motor

The servo motor included in your Photon kit can rotate back or forth to any position between 0° and ~180° and hold its position. \(In reality, this servo motor only physically rotates to about 160°, even if it is told to rotate to 180°.\)

The servo motor comes with 4 different plastic mounts called "horns" that can be attached to the motor axis \(the white part sticking out of the top of the motor – this is what actually rotates\). There is a single-arm horn, a double-arm horn, a four-point horn, and a circular horn. Each horn slips onto the motor axis \(the horn and axis have matching "teeth"\). Each horn has holes, which can allow you to attach something to the horn using the included small screws.

This servo motor is designed to rotate to a specific angle and hold its position. It does **NOT** rotate continuously, like a motor used in a fan or an engine. If your IoT device requires a motor that can rotate continuously, then you need a [gear motor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11696) or a [continuous rotation servo motor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9347).
