# Trimpot Dial

Your Photon kit includes a "trimpot" \(trimmable potentiometer\) that can be rotated and used as a dial. A potentiometer is a variable resistor that can be adjusted by sliding, rotating, or another type of physical interaction. Potentiometers are used in various devices such as: joysticks and game controllers, control knobs and sliders, dimmer switches for lights, volume knobs for stereos, etc.

The trimpot dial can be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise approximately 270Â° \(it does **NOT** rotate all the way around\). The position of the dial can be measured and used as an input for a value that has a range from minimum to maximum.
