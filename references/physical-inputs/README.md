# Physical Inputs

Here are references for how to connect and code each physical input in your SparkFun Photon kit:

* [Push Buttons](push-buttons.md)
* [Trimpot Dial](trimpot-dial.md)
* [Motion Sensor](motion-sensor.md)
* [Magnetic Switch](magnetic-switch.md)
* [Light Sensor](light-sensor.md)
* [Temperature Sensor](temperature-sensor.md)
* [Soil Moisture Sensor](soil-moisture-sensor.md)
* [Accelerometer](accelerometer.md)
* [Ultrasonic Sensor](ultrasonic-sensor.md) \(not standard part of SparkFun Photon kit, but your teacher may have added it\)

**OTHER SENSORS:**  There are [code references for other sensors](https://docs.idew.org/internet-of-things-project/references-for-wiring-and-coding) such as RFID Reader, Fingerprint Scanner, and GPS Receiver in the old project guidebook. These references will eventually be transferred into this new code guidebook.
