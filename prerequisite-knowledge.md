# Prerequisite Knowledge

## Physical Computing

Previous experience building and programming devices with an Arduino electronics kit \(such as: robotics kit, etc.\) is very helpful – however, it is NOT required. The IoT tutorials will assume that students have no prior experience in physical computing.

## Web Development

Familiarity with the following is highly recommended before programming a web app for an IoT device – however, mastery is NOT required:

### HTML

* Tag syntax for common HTML elements, such as: `<div>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<span>`, `<a>`,`<img>`, `<button>`, etc.
* Nesting of HTML elements within other elements
* Use of `class` and `id` attributes for HTML elements

### CSS

* CSS selectors for elements, classes, and ids
* Common properties used in styles, such as: `background-color`, `color`, `font-size`, `margin`, `padding`, `border`, `width`, `height`, `display`, etc.

### JavaScript \(including jQuery\)

* Variables – declaring unique identifiers, assigning values, data types \(numbers, strings, boolean, etc.\), global vs. local scope
* Functions – creating function, calling function, passing arguments, returning value
* Objects – constructing new object using defined class, using object properties and methods
* Comparison Operators -- such as: `>`, `<`, `==`, `!=`, etc.
* Conditional Statements using `if` and `else`
* Loops -- such as: `for`, `while`, etc.
* Events -- such as: `onclick`, `onchange`, etc.
* jQuery selectors for elements, classes, and ids
* jQuery syntax for basic functions -- such as: `.html()`, `.show()`, `.hide()`, `.addClass()`, `.removeClass()`, etc.
