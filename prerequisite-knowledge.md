# Prerequisite Knowledge

## Physical Computing

Previous experience building and programming devices using an Arduino electronics kit – such as a robotics kit, etc. – is very helpful. However, it is NOT required. The IoT tutorials will assume that students have no prior experience in developing physical computing devices.

## Electric Circuits

Having a basic conceptual understanding of electric circuits is very helpful, so students can better understand how to correctly connect the parts in their IoT electronics kit \(and how to troubleshoot connection issues\). However, understanding how to solve quantitative problems using equations for electric circuits \(e.g., Ohm's Law, etc.\) is NOT required. The IoT tutorials will provide a limited explanation of electric circuits sufficient for completing the IoT project.

* Atoms and Electrons
* Static Electricity vs. Current Electricity
* Conductors vs. Insulators
* Closed Circuit vs. Open Circuit
* Voltage, Current, and Resistance
* Series Circuit vs. Parallel Circuit

## Web Development

Previous experience and familiarity with the following web development concepts and skills is highly recommended before programming apps for an IoT device – however, mastery is NOT required:

### HTML

* Tag syntax for common HTML elements – such as: `<div>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<span>`, `<a>`,`<img>`, `<button>`, `<input>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, etc.
* Nesting of HTML elements within other elements
* Use of `class` and `id` attributes for HTML elements
* Loading external files – such as: CSS style sheets, JavaScript files, images, other web pages, etc. 

### CSS

* CSS selectors for HTML elements, classes, and ids
* Common properties used in styles – such as: `background-color`, `color`, `font-size`, `margin`, `padding`, `border`, `width`, `height`, `display`, etc.

### JavaScript \(including jQuery\)

* Variables – declaring names \(unique identifiers\), assigning and changing values, data types \(numbers, strings, boolean, etc.\), global vs. local scope
* Functions – creating function, calling function, passing arguments, returning value
* Objects – constructing new object using defined class, using object properties and methods
* Comparison Operators – such as: `>`, `<`, `==`, `!=`, etc.
* Logical Operators \(NOT, AND, OR\): `!`, `&&`, `||`
* Conditional Statements using `if` and `else`
* Loops – such as: `for`, `while`, etc.
* Events – such as: `onclick`, `onchange`, etc.
* jQuery selectors for HTML elements, classes, and ids
* jQuery syntax for basic functions – such as: `.html()`, `.show()`, `.hide()`, `.addClass()`, `.removeClass()`, etc.
